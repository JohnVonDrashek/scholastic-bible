# Scholastic Bible Visual Style Guide

This guide ensures all generated illustrations maintain a consistent medieval illuminated manuscript aesthetic appropriate for a scholarly Catholic Bible.

## Core Aesthetic

The visual style draws from three primary influences:

1. **Insular Art** (Book of Kells, Lindisfarne Gospels)
   - Intricate Celtic knotwork and interlace patterns
   - Elaborate decorated initials
   - Stylized animal and human figures

2. **Romanesque Manuscripts** (11th-12th century)
   - Bold outlines and flat color areas
   - Architectural framing elements
   - Hierarchical figure scaling

3. **Gothic Illumination** (13th-15th century)
   - Naturalistic details within stylized frameworks
   - Rich gold leaf backgrounds
   - Ivy and acanthus leaf borders

## Things to Avoid

- **ANY TEXT OR LETTERING**: Imagen cannot reliably spell. Never request:
  - Labels or names on figures
  - Banners or scrolls with writing
  - Decorative text or inscriptions
  - Book titles or chapter numbers
  - Any words, letters, or characters
  - Convey all meaning through imagery alone
- **Modern elements**: Contemporary clothing, technology, architecture
- **Photorealistic style**: Maintain stylized, iconic quality
- **3D rendering**: Keep flat, illustrative quality
- **Overly dark images**: Maintain legibility and warm tones
- **Cluttered compositions**: Leave breathing room
- **Inconsistent style mixing**: Stay within medieval aesthetic
